## Can I contribute?

Yes, if you wish you can definitely contribute but keep in mind that ***this is a program where computer generates random number for the user to guess and not the vice versa***.

*Yes you can take and use this code as this project itself is inpired from someone else's program, and by inspire I mean only a part of this program's logic has been inspired.*
